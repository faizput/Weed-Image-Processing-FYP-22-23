# Weed-Image-Classification for Precision Agriculture (FYP-22-23)

## Overview
This includes the main code for my machine learning training and evaluation. The datasets used for the project were not provided in these repositories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project were sourced by my supervisor. The dataset contained images of broad-leaves and narrow-leaves weeds.

## Model
The project utilized transfer learning techniques by using structure and weights from 5 keras model pre-trained with the given dataset. The model used were VGG16, MobileNet V2, Xception, ResNet 50 V2 and Inception V3(2023). The project were then improved/modified in 2025 using only 3 which is VGG19, VGG16 and MobileNet V2 with some added evaluation metric.

## Evaluation Metrics Preview
Below are few examples of metrics used to evaluete the model.
